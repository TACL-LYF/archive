LYF Camp <%= @camp.year %> Registration Confirmation

Thank you for registering for LYF Camp <%= @camp.year %>!
We have received your registration(s) for the camper(s) listed below.

As camp approaches and the COVID-19 situation is amenable to holding a physical camp, we will invoice
registered campers for the cost of camp (minus applicable discounts). Payment information for credit or
debit card will be collected then through a separate online form.

If the situation is determined to be unsafe for a physical camp, we will hold a virtual camp instead.
In the event we switch to a virtual camp, registration costs will be adjusted and registered campers
will have the option to confirm or cancel their registration.

If any of this information needs to be updated, or you would like to include any comments,
please email emily.chou@tacl.org.

<% if @is_waitlist %>
Because we received your registration after the general registration period or after we reached
our maximum capacity for camp, you have been added to our waitlist. We will contact you if
space becomes available; if not, we will issue a refund of your registration fee.
Please look out for an email from us in the near future.

<% else %>
Be on the lookout for a final email that will be sent as Camp approaches!
It will include your Camper Welcome Packet, which contains a packing list, camp schedule,
camp rules, and Parent's Program information.

We look forward to seeing you at camp!
