        <h1 class="modal-title">Registration Policy</h1>
        <p class="space-above-med">General Registration closes on <%= @camp.registration_close_date.to_s(:short_ordinal) %>. We are suspending late registration fees and are delaying payment of camp fees until camp approaches.</p>
        <p>If your child has a conflict due to other extra-curricular activities (graduation, recitals, etc.), you can pull him/her out of camp for the conflict. Simply note on our registration form when you are picking up and dropping off your child. Because we would love all campers the opportunity to join us at camp, they are welcome to leave early if need be. Unfortunately, the camp fee cannot be prorated.</p>

        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
        <p>In this time of uncertainty, we want parents to feel flexible and comfortable with their decision to send kids to camp. This year, we will have a no-worry cancellation policy. Cancellations can be made up until camp. Additionally camp fees will not be due until just prior to camp. <b>If you will be cancelling and have already paid for registration costs, we will apply 2021 registration fees to 2022 camp by default, and will issue refunds upon request.</b> To cancel your registration, please send an email with your name and your camper's name to  <%= mail_to "lyf@tacl.org", "lyf@tacl.org" %>.</p>

        <h1 class="modal-title">Discounts and Financial Aid</h1>
        <h3>Sibling Discount</h3>
        <p>
          For families with multiple campers, we will be granting an additional <%= number_to_currency(@camp.sibling_discount, precision: 0) %> discount per sibling. This amount will be deducted from the total camp fee. In order to receive this sibling discount, campers must be direct family, and registered at the same time. The sibling discount only applies to general registration and is not applicable to late registration.
        </p>

        <h3>Financial Aid</h3>
        <p>We do not want camp fees to prevent you from attending camp. Every year, we have options for families that may need financial assistance. Please email <%= mail_to "lyf@tacl.org", "lyf@tacl.org" %> to find out if you qualify.</p>

        <h3>Refer a Friend!</h3>
        <p>Campers who bring new friends to LYF Camp will receive a $30 discount from camp fees for each referral (there is no limit - if you refer 10 new campers, you will get a $300 discount!!). The campers being referred <b>must</b> write your camper's name into their registration form and must have not attended LYF Camp before. For example, if Anna Chen brings Charles to camp, then on Charles' registration form under the "How did you hear about us?" question, check the box "referred by a TACL-LYF Camper" and write Anna Chen's name. Please note that a sibling may not count as a referral. The sibling discount will be applied instead.</p>
        <p>After the last day of camp, we will verify the referrals and refund $30 per verified referral credited directly back to your credit card. If you have any questions, please email <%= mail_to "lyf@tacl.org", "lyf@tacl.org" %>.</p>
